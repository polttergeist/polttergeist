<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<!--
<p align="center">
I'm a young, passionate guy from an astonishingly beautiful city of Saint Petersburg. A list of my hobbies includes a wide spectrum of different things, e.g. music, languages, programming, exploring my city and weeping into my pillow. I'm really an outgoing person who likes making new aquaintances, but at the same time I'm a sensitive introvert who needs a lot of personal space.

Welcome at my GitHub page, where you can find lots of questionable code, as well as some nice-looking projects which were likely to be finished at the last day before the deadline. Nonetheless, I'm trying to grow as a person and to develop as a developer.
